# rust-backend-template
This repository is designed to be used in conjuction with [rust-fullstack-template](https://github.com/michael-long88/rust-fullstack-template). It provides basic CRUD functionality and is a template to build upon. Although it currently uses PostgreSQL for the database, `axum` supports other databases and can easily be swapped out.
